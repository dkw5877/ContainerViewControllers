Port Hercule is amongst the most recognizable marinas in the world. In high demand during the summer season, the port also hosts a number of large yachts during winter. Amongst its most frequent guests are the Lady Moura, Atlantis II and Wedge Too. The marina can also accommodate yachts over 120 meters but these must compete for one berthing space with cruise ships during the summer.

In 2010 the Finnish manufacturer of marinas and pontoons Marinetek was hired to deliver three new pontoons to Port Hercule. Monaco's old fixed piers were replaced by Marinetek's floating concrete pontoons. The renovation was completed in 2011.
